<p>
  HL2 group joining the LoRa Alliance was self-evident after these last 3 years devoted to developing our set of technologies based on LPWAN.
</p>

<p>
  As active contributors to ETSI - the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which provides specifications for the virtualization of network services, and thus determines the standards of LTN - it seemed only natural to become a member of the LoRa Alliance.
</p>

<p>
  Our specialty is to bring to market a range of products and services allowing
  the development of networks of intelligent objects, communicating through LPWAN:
  <ul>
    <li>pre-assembled rapid-prototyping hardware</li>
    <li>embedded software</li>
    <li>dual technology LPWAN modems (LoRa & SigFox)</li>
    <li>telecom subscriptions</li>
    <li>SaaS applications</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This membership will allow us to strengthen our leading position
  on the LoRaWAN market, by expanding our partners ecosystem.
