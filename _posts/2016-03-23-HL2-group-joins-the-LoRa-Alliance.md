HL2 group joining the LoRa Alliance was self-evident after these last 3 years devoted to developing our set of technologies based on LPWAN.

As active contributors to ETSI - the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which provides specifications for the virtualization of network services, and thus determines the standards of LTN - it seemed only natural to become a member of the LoRa Alliance.

Our specialty is to bring to market a range of products and services allowing
the development of networks of intelligent objects, communicating through LPWAN:
- pre-assembled rapid-prototyping hardware
- embedded software
- dual technology LPWAN modems (LoRa & SigFox)
- telecom subscriptions
- SaaS applications

This membership will allow us to strengthen our leading position
on the LoRaWAN market, by expanding our partners ecosystem.
