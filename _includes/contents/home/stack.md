## LPWAN on steroids

Our innovative network stack features two protocols, **SCAP** (Secure Constrained Application Protocol) and **LTP** (Lightweight Transport Protocol) specifically targeted at LPWAN networks, and addressing their limitations:

- improved QoS
- improved performance
- segmentation & recombination (*2 patents pending*)
- heightened end-to-end security, from device to application, independent of operators or technologies
- simplified development workflow

**It's LPWAN as it should be: simple, secure, and feature-complete**.
