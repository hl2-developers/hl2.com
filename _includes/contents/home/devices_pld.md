## Don't own an LPWAN device? Use ours!

Our generic and open device, the PLD, is Sigfox- and LoRaWAN-compatible, and **fully customizable**.

PLD means "Place and Leave Device". Literally. It sports **a rugged, waterproof case**, and can be powered through a **long-life lithium cell** (up to 10 years of operation) or using its standard battery holder.

It is **Arduino™ compatible** - we provide the library source code on GitHub™, alongside the manual, examples, and other resources.

**The PLD makes prototyping a breeze, but can also be used as the core of your production devices.**
