## Operator roaming made easy

Think you have to choose an operator beforehand and stick with it? Think again: with our solution, your hardware can be connected to **several** LPWAN providers, and **switch** between them to always use the best connection available.

We support:
- [Loriot](//loriot.io){:target="_blank"}
- [Sigfox](//sigfox.com){:target="_blank"}
- [Orange](//orange-business.com){:target="_blank"}
- [T.T.N.](//thethingsnetwork.org){:target="_blank"} (*pending*)

**The choice is yours. We've done all the hard work so you don't have to**.
